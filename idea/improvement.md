My aim of developing this entire project is to allow user to store their files and assets in their own cloud storage accounts rather than relying on a third-party storage service. This approach provides users with greater control over their data, enhanced privacy, and potentially lower costs, as they can utilize their existing cloud storage solutions. This helps to keep their data safely and securely without depending on external providers like Google Drive or OneDrive or Dropbox.

But Current Implementation that we have provided our own s3 bucket keys and cloud storage up to 5gb for free usage makes us another Google Drive or Dropbox clone which is not the intention. The intention is to allow user to use their own cloud storage accounts to store their files and assets.

Now We Need to think of the way to implement this feature where user can provide their own cloud storage credentials and we can use those credentials to upload and manage files on behalf of the user. But managing credentials of tech savy platform like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage can be complex for non-tech savy users. And also they need to generate access keys and secret keys from their cloud storage providers which can be a tedious task for non-tech savy users. And in the first place they need to have an account on those cloud storage providers.
